Practical Five

Please create a variant workflow that uses 8 threads (on every software that is multithreaded) as a qsub script and submit it. Use https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/04-variant_calling/index.html as a starting point. Put the script in this repo. Then when you get your vcf file, open it in IGV either on the crcfe01 or crcfe02, or on your own computer. 

You may use this [data](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454?file=14502617)
