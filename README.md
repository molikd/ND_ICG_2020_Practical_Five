Practical Five

Please create a variant workflow that uses 8 threads (on every software that is multithreaded) as a qsub script and submit it. Use https://datacarpentry.org/wrangling-genomics/04-variant_calling/index.html as a starting point. Put the script in this repo. Then when you get your vcf file, open it in IGV either on the crcfe01 or crcfe02, or on your own computer.
